meta-skarnet
============

This layer contains a set of recipes for skarnet.org's software. In particular,
it contains all software required to build an s6-based init system.

However, in keeping with skarnet's tradition of providing mechanism over
policy, this layer attempts to focus on compiling and packaging. Also, if
customizations are made, it is always done using a variable to let distribution
maintainers use their own defaults.
